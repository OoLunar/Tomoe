**Privacy Policy for Tomoe the Discord Bot**
*Last Updated: May 5th, 2025*

This Privacy Policy explains how Tomoe ("the Bot") handles your data. By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described below. The Bot is provided by Tomoe's Maintainers ("we," "us," or "our"), which includes the developers and contributors of the Bot.

### **1. Data We Collect**
The Bot **only stores data explicitly provided by users or server administrators** for functionality, including:
- Server-specific settings (e.g., configured preferences, custom commands).
- User-provided content (e.g., messages or IDs required for features like warnings or reminders).
- User IDs and server IDs for moderation actions (e.g., bans, kicks).

We do **not** collect:
- Sensitive personal information (e.g., passwords, financial data).
- Activity logs, analytics, or metadata unrelated to core features.

### **2. How We Use Data**
- Data is used **solely to operate the Bot’s features** as intended (e.g., moderation actions, custom commands).
- Data is **not used for training AI/ML models, advertising, or profiling**.
- Data is **not shared with third parties**, except:
  - If legally required (e.g., court order).
  - To comply with Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

### **3. Data Retention**
- Data is retained **only as long as necessary** to provide Bot functionality.
- Server or user data is **deleted automatically** if:
  - The Bot is removed from a server.
  - A user requests deletion (see Section 5).
  - The data is no longer needed (e.g., completed reminders).

### **4. Data Security**
- We implement basic safeguards to protect stored data (e.g., encryption for sensitive settings).
- However, no system is 100% secure. **Do not provide sensitive information** to the Bot.

### **5. Your Rights**
You may:
- Request access to or deletion of your data by contacting us (Section 8).
- Remove the Bot from your server to delete associated data.

### **6. Compliance with Discord**
The Bot operates under Discord’s [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) and [Developer Terms](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal). We do not access or store data beyond what Discord permits.

### **7. Children’s Privacy**
The Bot is **not directed at minors under 13**. If we discover a user under 13, we will delete their data and disallow future access to the Bot.

### **8. Changes to This Policy**
We may update this policy. Changes will be announced via each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/OoLunar/Tomoe/releases).
