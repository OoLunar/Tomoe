## Prerequisites

Tomoe uses dotnet 7.0. You can get it from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0). Tomoe should work on all OS' that .NET is supported on. Mono is not supported due to DSharpPlus intentionally choosing not to support it.

## Setup
Edit your `res/config.json` file. If you're planning on contributing to the bot, copy the `res/config.json` file to `config.json.prod` and edit that instead.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/OoLunar/Tomoe.git
cd Tomoe
dotnet restore
```

Be sure to edit your config file `res/config.json` .

``` bash
dotnet run
```

### Docker

``` bash
docker run ghcr.io/oolunar/tomoe --mount ./res,/src/res
```

### Docker-Compose

Make sure to review the `volumes` section of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

``` bash
docker-compose up -d
```
